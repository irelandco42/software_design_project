# Software Design Project

Pixelated game created with the help of Megan Nicholson and Todd Byrd.

Some notes:
* The main.cpp file is the primary c++ file wich operates the game, controlling what menus are displayed and what state the game is in.
* The StatsAndStatus file does all the loading and exporting of data when is come to working with prior/current high scores.
* The myLib file has all the back-end objects and strctures for the game.
